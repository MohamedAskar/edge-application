# Edge.

E-Commerece Mobile App Powered by [Akin](https://asymmetrik.com/recommendation-engine-analytics/) Recommendation Engine.

We have used Flutter as our Framework of Choice to build a cutting-edge cross platform mobile application that will offer a great UI throughout IOS and Android. The app has two different UIs, One for the regular User. And another one for the Admin or the Publisher to add new items easily and manage orders and communicate with users.
